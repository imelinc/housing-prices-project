# Boston Housing Prices Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using the **Boston Housing Dataset**.

## Dataset
The [Boston Housing Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/boston-housing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd)) contains 506 instances with 13 features, including:
- **PTRATIO**: Ratio of students per teacher on the neighborhood
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower-status population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and explore correlations.
2. **Modeling**: Implement Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
3. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² to assess model performance.

## Results
- Linear Regression: Baseline model with moderate performance.
- Random Forest: Improved accuracy with feature importance analysis.
- Visualizations: Feature correlations and prediction errors plotted.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks.
- Incorporate feature engineering (e.g., polynomial features).
- Address potential dataset biases.
