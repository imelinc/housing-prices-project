# Boston Housing Prices Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Boston using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. By leveraging regression techniques, we explore how features like the number of rooms, crime rate, and proximity to employment centers influence house prices. The project is ideal for beginners learning regression in machine learning.

## Dataset
The [Boston Housing Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/boston-housing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd)) contains 506 instances with 13 features, including:
- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower-status population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and explore correlations.
2. **Modeling**: Implement Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
3. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² to assess model performance.

## Results
- Linear Regression: Baseline model with moderate performance.
- Random Forest: Improved accuracy with feature importance analysis.
- Visualizations: Feature correlations and prediction errors plotted.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks.
- Incorporate feature engineering (e.g., polynomial features).
- Address potential dataset biases.
