    "# Boston Housing Prices Prediction Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict house prices in Boston using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. The dataset includes 506 samples and 13 features, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and socio-economic indicators, with the target variable being the median house price (MEDV). This project is designed for beginners to practice regression techniques and understand the end-to-end machine learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Explore and visualize the dataset to identify key patterns and correlations.\n",
    "- Preprocess the data to handle missing values and scale features.\n",
    "- Train and evaluate regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest.\n",
    "- Interpret results to understand feature importance and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd) is used, with features like:\n",
    "- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town\n",
    "- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling\n",
    "- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower-status population\n",
    "- **MEDV**: Median house price (in $1000s, target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Load the dataset using pandas.\n",
    "   - Visualize distributions and correlations (e.g., heatmap, scatter plots).\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Check for missing values and outliers.\n",
    "   - Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler.\n",
    "   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
    "3. **Modeling**:\n",
    "   - Train a Linear Regression model as a baseline.\n",
    "   - Train a Random Forest model for improved performance.\n",
    "   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (optional).\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Compute Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.\n",
    "   - Visualize predicted vs. actual prices.\n",
    "   - Analyze feature importance for Random Forest.\n",
    "5. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - Summarize model performance and key findings.\n",
    "   - Discuss limitations and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Understand the relationship between housing features and prices.\n",
    "- Compare the performance of simple (Linear Regression) vs. complex (Random Forest) models.\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\n"
